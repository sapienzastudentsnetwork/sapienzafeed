<div>
<div><p>The course is mainly focused on system programming for Unix/Linux systems.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The objective is to make students able to understand, write and modify, programs interfacing with the Linux operating system and its kernel source code.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More precisely, we expect the students to acquire knowledge of:</p>
<ol><li>the C language and the tools normally used in the development environment (compiler, preprocessor, debugger, make, shell, etc.)</li>
<li>the fundamental functions of the operating system and its main modules (Scheduler, Virtual Memory Manager, Filesystem..).</li>
<li>the main system primitives for the creation and synchronization of processes, exchange of messages and information (this is the core of the course)</li>
<li>primitives for network programming (sockets)</li>
</ol><p>and then be able to:</p>
<ol><li>use the primitives provided by the operating system and integrate them correctly into the code.</li>
<li>choose the most suitable OS component and functions, based on the needs of the applications and their execution mode.</li>
<li>determine the complexity and how to implement a system application.</li>
<li>describe the interaction of an application with the operating system and explain the reasons behind the choices.</li>
<li>continue learning by examining, in detail, the architecture and programming interface of the operating system.</li>
