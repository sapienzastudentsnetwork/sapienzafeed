<div class="field-item even"><p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">MASTER PROGRAMME STUDY PLANS</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Students of the Master Programme in Cybersecurity are required to have a study plan (‚Äúpercorso formativo‚Äù) in force in order to book and take exams.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">WHAT IS A STUDY PLAN?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">A study plan completely defines the set of courses that a student plans to attend and to clear during their first and second year. Without an approved study plan, students cannot book or take <strong>any</strong> exam.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Hence, students of the Master Programme in Cybersecurity are requested to submit for approval their own study plans at the <strong>beginning of their first year.</strong> A study plan already in force can be<strong> revised</strong> by submitting for approval a new plan which includes <strong>all</strong> courses already cleared.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">WHEN CAN A STUDY PLAN BE SUBMITTED OR REVISED?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Students can submit their study plans <strong>at most once per year</strong>, during the following time window: </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>From September 15</strong> to <strong>December 31 </strong>of each year.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Study plans still pending evaluation cannot be changed. For this reason, we warmly recommend students to pay great attention when submitting their study plans, and to do so only when they have clear ideas about which courses to attend (at the very least in their next year).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">HOW A STUDY PLAN IS SUBMITTED?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Study plans must be submitted using the online study plan submission system called ‚ÄúPercorsi Formativi‚Äù reachable from within <a href="http://www.uniroma1.it/studenti" target="_blank">Infostud</a>. </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">WHEN AND HOW IS A STUDY PLAN EVALUATED AND APPROVED?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The study plan submission system prevents the submission of most (but not all) study plans violating the rules. Plans successfully submitted via the system are evaluated and approved by the study plan evaluation committee.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Study plans which satisfy all the rules, envision a proper balance of the number of exams to be cleared in the first and second year, and contain only courses offered within the Master Programme in Cybersecurity will be approved automatically. Study plans envisioning a not even allocation of the courses between the two years, and those plans envisioning courses from other Sapienza programmes in section "Group D‚Äù, are subject to an evaluation by the committee, which will decide whether to accept them or reject them by performing additional checks on the student curriculum to ensure their feasibility and coherence, and to avoid abnormal situations. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">WHEN DOES AN APPROVED STUDY PLAN COME INTO FORCE?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Study plans come into force from the academic year in which they have been submitted and will be in force until a new replacement study plan is submitted <em>and </em>approved. </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Please note that although academic years start in September, their first exam session starts in January of the <em>following </em>year. This means that any exam session held from September to December belongs to the previous academic year and can be used by students only to clear exams of courses that belong to their study plans already approved in the <strong>previous</strong> academic year.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">WHAT HAPPENS IF A STUDY PLAN IS REJECTED?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">If a study plan is rejected, the student will be immediately contacted by a member of the evaluation committee to give recommendations, fix the problems, and find an agreement on a new study plan, which will be submitted and approved by the committee.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">HOW DO STUDY PLANS AFFECT THE POSSIBILITY OF BOOKING OR CLEARING EXAMS?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The Infostud system <strong>forbids</strong> students to book and clear an exam not included in their study plan currently in force. The consequence of the above rule is that students with no study plan in force (because they never submitted one for approval) cannot book or take any exam.  </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The study plans evaluation committee <a href="mailto:venturi@di.uniroma1.it" target="_blank">can be contacted via email</a>: <a href="mailto:venturi@di.uniroma1.it" target="_blank">venturi@di.uniroma1.it</a>. The committee kindly invites students to <strong>avoid</strong> asking questions whose answers are already in the text above. The committee will do their best to answer within a week. </span></span></p>
