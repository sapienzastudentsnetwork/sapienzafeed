<p> </p>
<p>Leadership and Organizational Change is a 9 Credits (72 Hours) course of the Business Management Curriculum (Master Degree), aiming to allow students to learn the reasons and motivations behind the process of organizational change (with particular regard to radical-transformational change), the phases that characterize this process and the problems business firms face in effectively carrying out a project of change.</p>
<p>The topic of organizational change will be tackled by considering the most recent technological, operational, managerial and organizational innovations and the way in which they impact on business models, fundamental operational processes, organizational structures, culture and practices of Human Resource Management. This will help to understand the fundamental variables of the organization, on which to lever for the effective implementation of the change project, having regard to organizational performance and the achievement and improvement of competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Moreover, the analysis of the relationships and interdependencies that characterize the abovementioned variables will allow to obtain a systemic view of the complex connections between organization, strategy and environment and how organizational change emerges from their mutual interaction.</p>
<p>The 2023-2024 edition of the Course will be divided into two complementary parts. The first – 48 hours – will focus on the traditional themes of organizational change and leadership, while the second – 24 hours – (named “Innovation dynamics and organizational behaviors: the Semiconductor Industry case study”), will address the issues of change with particular regard to the sector of semiconductors, considered to be the basis of the development of the microelectronics industry. This subdivision does not imply that it is possible to take two different exams, 6 and 3 credits, as the course is unitary and passing the exam will give the right to a single and unitary grade.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><strong>2. </strong><strong>Training Aims</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>2.1 General Aims</strong></span></p>
<p>The main objective of the course is to transfer analytical knowledge about the process of change management of the firm and the ways in which the leadership acts within organizations.</p>
<p>Students will be able to recognize, face and solve problems arising in the different phases of the organizational change (from the planning of the organizational change, to the mapping of factors that can inhibit or favor the success of the plan itself, to the identification of the supporting roles in the implementation of the change, to the monitoring of the achieved results), also allowing to frame the relationships among organizational, environmental, strategic and operational variables and their mutual link in the change processes, considering their impact on the business performance.</p>
<p>Through appropriate models of organizational analysis, the course will provide adequate knowledge on the effects of systemic change processes and their impact on the main organizational variables.</p>
<p>The course will also provide knowledge on how to exercise leadership in change processes, through the analysis and comparison of leadership styles that can lead to improvements in organizational climate and socio-relational context with respect to toxic leadership style.</p>
<p>The course intends to eventually transfer students with adequate knowledge about the role that organizational culture and processes have in managing human resources to support the effectiveness of change management.</p>
<p>These objectives will be pursued through the adoption of an appropriate mix of lectures, individual jobs, group exercises and testimonies of organizational experts from the business world.</p>
<p>In particular, the special program on <em>Innovation dynamics and organizational behaviors: the Semiconductor Industry case study</em>, aims to walk through technology and innovation management challenges of the highly competitive semiconductor industry, from the perspective of leaders who have worked in this sector over the past 40 years. Innovation strategy driven by Moore’s law and organizational capabilities needed to compete in a highly capital and knowledge-driven environment are described through examples, cases and lessons learned matured in the field. Emerging trends and technologies as well as new skills and capabilities to address future challenges are explored through a sustainable and people-centric vision.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:22px"><strong>2.2 </strong><strong>Specific Aims</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20px"><a id="_Toc507671540" name="_Toc507671540"><strong>2.2.1 </strong><strong>Knowledge and understanding.</strong></a></span></p>
<p><a id="_Toc507671541" name="_Toc507671541">At the end of the course, students will be able to recognize and face analytically the problems inherent in a process of organizational change, also thanks to the knowledge of models and tools applicable to the specific phases of planning, implementation and control of the change process.</a></p>
<p>This knowledge will be acquired by adopting an analytical perspective that considers the effects of changes on business models, on the main operational processes, on the organizational structure and practices and related to the development of Human Resources, aimed at understanding the existing systemic relationships. among these components of the organizational action and their impact on the performance of the business firm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the understanding of the links between environmental, strategic and organizational variables will allow to analyze and solve problems related to the different phases of the organizational change of the firm, in the search for consistency among these variables and in compliance with the economic conditions of the firm itself.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>2.2.2 </strong><strong>Applying knowledge and understanding.</strong></span></p>
<p>Through individual work and project work, also commissioned by important Italian entrepreneurial realities, students will be enabled not only to understand the origin, nature and typology of the various problems inherent in the processes of organizational change, but also to elaborate specific solutions using techniques, models and analysis tools transferred during the lectures.</p>
<p>The presentation by the students of the results of the group work will allow the development of capabilities for reflection and argumentation, together with the ability to exchange, share and display the results achieved.</p>
<p>Lectures from organizational experts coming from leading business organizations and the discussion of the related topics with the students, finally, will allow to corroborate - also with a practical feedback - the ability to apply the techniques and the results achieved by students themselves, and learn from any mistakes made.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:20px"><a id="_Toc507671542" name="_Toc507671542"><strong>2.2.3 </strong><strong>Making judgements.</strong></a></span></p>
<p><a id="_Toc507671543" name="_Toc507671543">The course, through mixed methods of content delivery (lectures, individual and group work, company testimonials), while devoting adequate space to the main theoretical models in the reference literature, intends to stimulate students to realize a personal vision of organizational phenomena, encouraging autonomy of judgment and the creative solution, even if oriented and guided by the teacher, of the consequent problems.</a></p>
<p>In particular, individual and group work will be designed to increase critical, reflexive and independent judging skills, including that aimed at avoiding the biases that characterize the decision-making processes in this area. solving, also with regard to the ethical and social consequences that distinguish organizational choices.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>2.2.4 </strong><strong>Communication skills.</strong></span></p>
<p>The performance of several case studies (at individual and group level) and the presentation of the results achieved is an important tool for the development of communication skills. In particular, the exercises are specifically designed to allow students to learn how to interact and communicate, simulating knowledge sharing activities and building consensus typical of real work contexts.</p>
<p>These skills represent a "natural" component of the contents of the course, given that the subject of organizational communication is a specific issue to be developed in order to support the organizational change process.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:20px"><a id="_Toc507671544" name="_Toc507671544"><strong>2.2.5 </strong><strong>Learning skills.</strong></a></span></p>
<p>Considering the high transversal and multidisciplinary nature of the topics the course will dealt with, the contents of which can easily be transferred even in organizational contexts other than business firms, the course of Leadership &amp; Organizational Change allows to acquire theoretical, conceptual and applicative knowledge that can be used for a multiplicity of educational and practical paths subsequent to that of the three-year degree.</p>
<p>In addition, being the course the natural continuation of a master's degree course, not only in managerial or business areas, students will acquire skills that can be further developed, even independently, and used in companies, consulting firms and other organizations, as well as for the establishment of innovative, high-tech start-ups.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size:22px"><a id="_Toc507671545" name="_Toc507671545"><strong>2.3 </strong><strong>Prerequisit</strong></a><strong>es </strong></span></h2>
<p>Although the issues of the organization can be learned independently from previous economic-business knowledge, an essential requirement for the students is, however, the possess of fundamental notions about the firm’s economy and functioning, with particular regard to its nature, its characteristics - operational and management criteria and the economic and financial conditions that underlie its dynamics.</p>
<p>This knowledge is typically provided in Business Economics and Management courses, which for this reason must be considered mandatory to that of Leadership &amp; Organizational Change</p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Lingua di erogazione e di svolgimento dell’esame: Italiano</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">L’insegnamento di Organizzazione Aziendale (da 9 e 6 CFU – Laurea Triennale) intende fornire agli studenti le conoscenze e i “fondamentali” per l’analisi e la comprensione delle principali problematiche organizzative che caratterizzano le imprese moderne ed un ampio ventaglio di strumenti utili per la loro risoluzione.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In particolare, l’approfondimento delle tematiche relative al comportamento organizzativo e alla progettazione organizzativa consente di esaminare le caratteristiche del processo di costruzione e di implementazione dell’assetto organizzativo a livello micro, meso e macro-aziendale, sino ai modelli reticolari che collegano l’impresa focale ad altre organizzazioni presenti nell’ambiente di riferimento.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Tale percorso aiuta a comprendere le variabili (e le leve) fondamentali dell’organizzazione, sulle quali la direzione aziendale può agire per il miglioramento delle performance ed il conseguimento di posizioni di vantaggio competitivo sui concorrenti.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Inoltre, l’analisi delle relazioni e delle interdipendenze che caratterizzano le suddette variabili permette di ottenere una visione sistemica dei complessi collegamenti tra organizzazione, strategia ed ambiente.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><a id="_Toc507671537" name="_Toc507671537"><span style="color:#B22222"><strong>2 Obiettivi formativi</strong></span></a></span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><a id="_Toc507671538" name="_Toc507671538"><strong>2.1 </strong><strong>Obiettivi generali</strong></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Obiettivo  dell’insegnamento di Organizzazione Aziendale è il trasferimento di conoscenze di tipo analitico su come riconoscere, affrontare e risolvere i problemi che si presentano ai diversi livelli di progettazione e di implementazione dell’assetto organizzativo dell’impresa (dal lavoro dei singoli individui e dei gruppi, alla costruzione delle unità organizzative, sino alla progettazione dell’intero assetto organizzativo e delle relazioni interorganizzative), in una cornice di riferimento che consenta di inquadrare le relazioni tra variabili organizzative, ambientali, strategiche ed operative ed il loro collegamento con le performance d’impresa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Tale obiettivo sarà perseguito attraverso l’adozione di un appropriato mix di lezioni frontali, lavori individuali, esercitazioni di gruppo e testimonianze di esperti di organizzazione provenienti dal mondo delle imprese.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><a id="_Toc507671539" name="_Toc507671539"><strong>2.2 Obiettivi specifici</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><a id="_Toc507671540" name="_Toc507671540"><strong>2.2.1 </strong><strong>Conoscenza e capacità di comprensione (<em>knowledge and understanding</em>).</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><a id="_Toc507671541" name="_Toc507671541">Al termine dell’insegnamento gli studenti saranno in grado di riconoscere ed affrontare analiticamente i problemi organizzativi, disponendo di un ampio background sulle principali teorie dell’organizzazione e sui principi da queste scaturenti per loro soluzione, grazie anche alla conoscenza di modelli e strumenti applicabili alle specifiche problematiche della progettazione organizzativa.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Tali conoscenze saranno acquisite adottando una prospettiva di analisi multilivello (micro-meso-macro-meta organizzativo), finalizzata alla comprensione delle relazioni sistemiche che, partendo dall’organizzazione del lavoro a livello micro (individuale) e meso (gruppi/unità organizzative), consentono di indagare le proprietà emergenti riferite all’intera organizzazione (livello macro) e alle aggregazioni di imprese (livello meta), nonché il loro impatto sulle performance dell’impresa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Inoltre, la comprensione dei legami tra variabili ambientali, strategiche ed organizzative consentirà di analizzare e risolvere le problematiche afferenti ai diversi profili strategici e alle varie fasi del ciclo di vita delle imprese, nella ricerca della coerenza tra tali variabili e le forme organizzative emergenti, nel rispetto delle condizioni di economicità dell’impresa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>2.2.2 Capacità di applicare conoscenza e comprensione (<em>applying knowledge and understanding</em>).</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Attraverso i lavori individuali e di gruppo gli studenti saranno messi in condizione non solo di comprendere l’origine, la natura e la tipologia delle varie problematiche organizzative, ma di elaborare soluzioni condivise utilizzando tecniche, modelli e strumenti di analisi trasferiti durante le lezioni frontali.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">La presentazione, da parte degli studenti, dei risultati dei lavori di gruppo consentirà di sviluppare capacità di riflessione e di argomentazione, unitamente a capacità di scambio, condivisione ed esposizione dei risultati conseguiti.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Le testimonianze degli esperti di organizzazione provenienti da primarie organizzazioni imprenditoriali e la discussione dei relativi temi con gli studenti, infine, permetterà di corroborare – anche con un riscontro pratico – la capacità di applicazione delle tecniche e i risultati conseguiti dagli studenti stessi, e di apprendere dagli eventuali errori commessi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><a id="_Toc507671542" name="_Toc507671542"><strong>2.2.3 </strong><strong>Autonomia di giudizio (<em>making judgements</em>).</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><a id="_Toc507671543" name="_Toc507671543">L’insegnamento di Organizzazione Aziendale, attraverso modalità miste di erogazione dei contenuti (lezioni frontali, lavori individuali e di gruppo, testimonianze aziendali), pur dedicando un adeguato spazio ai principali modelli teorici consolidati nella letteratura di riferimento, intende stimolare gli studenti a realizzare una propria visione dei fenomeni organizzativi, incentivando l’autonomia di giudizio e la soluzione creativa, pur orientata e guidata dal docente, delle conseguenti problematiche.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In particolare, i lavori individuali e di gruppo sono ideati proprio per incrementare capacità critiche, di riflessione e di elaborazione autonoma di giudizi, compresa quella volta ad evitare i pregiudizi che caratterizzano in quest’area le fasi dei processi decisionali orientati al problem-solving, anche in ordine alle ricadute etiche e sociali che contraddistinguono le scelte organizzative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>2.2.4 Abilità comunicative (<em>communication skills</em>).</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Lo svolgimento di diversi case-study (a livello individuale e di gruppo) e la presentazione dei risultati raggiunti rappresenta un importante strumento, adottato nell’insegnamento di Organizzazione Aziendale, per lo sviluppo di capacità comunicative. In particolare, le esercitazioni sono appositamente costruite per consentire agli studenti di imparare ad interagire e a comunicare, simulando attività di condivisione delle conoscenze e di costruzione del consenso tipiche di contesti lavorativi reali.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Tali capacità rappresentano una componente “naturale” dell’insegnamento in oggetto, considerato che la tematica della comunicazione organizzativa costituisce argomento di specifica trattazione nell’ambito dello stesso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><a id="_Toc507671544" name="_Toc507671544"><strong>2.2.5 </strong><strong>Capacità di apprendimento (<em>learning skills</em>).</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Considerata l’elevata trasversalità e multidisciplinarietà dei temi trattati, i cui contenuti possono facilmente essere traslati anche in contesti organizzativi diversi dalle imprese (seppur caratterizzati da un orientamento al rispetto delle condizioni di economicità della gestione), l’insegnamento di Organizzazione Aziendale consente di acquisire una base teorica, concettuale ed applicativa utilizzabile per una molteplicità di percorsi educativi e pratici successivi a quello della laurea triennale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Oltre, infatti, alla naturale prosecuzione verso un percorso di laurea magistrale, non solo di tipo manageriale o aziendalistico, gli studenti acquisiranno competenze ulteriormente sviluppabili, anche in autonomia, ed utilizzabili in aziende, società di consulenza e altre organizzazioni, nonché per la costituzione di start-up innovative e ad elevato contenuto tecnologico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><a id="_Toc507671545" name="_Toc507671545"><strong>2.3 </strong><strong>Prerequisiti</strong></a></span></p>

<p>The course of Organization Design (Organizzazione Aziendale, 6 and 9 Credits) aims to provide students with the basic knowledge required for analyzing, understanding and dealing with the main organizational problems that characterize the modern firm, as well as a wide range of useful tools for their resolution.</p>
<p>In particular, the in-depth analysis of the issues related to organizational behavior and organizational design makes it possible to examine the characteristics of the design and the implementation of the organizational form at the micro, meso and macro level, up to the network that connects the focal enterprise to other organizations in the external environment.</p>
<p>This process helps to understand the fundamental variables of the organization design, on which managers can lever on to improve the firm’s performance, enabling it to achieve a competitive advantage over its competitors.</p>
<p>Moreover, the analysis of the relationships and interdependencies that characterize the abovementioned variables allows to obtain a systemic view of the complex connections between the organization, the strategy and the environment.</p>
<div>
<p><span style="color:#B22222"><span style="font-size:24px"><strong>1 </strong><strong>Training Aims</strong></span></span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size:24px"><strong>1.1 </strong><strong>General Aims</strong></span></p>
<p>The course mainly aims to transfer students analytical knowledge on how to recognize, face and solve organizational problems that manifest at different organizational levels – from individual and group/unit level up to the design of the entire organizational structure and interorganizational networks – categorizing them in an overall model that allows to frame the relationships between organizational, environmental, strategic and operational variables, and their connection with the business firm’s performance.</p>
<p>This goal will be pursued through the adoption of an appropriate mix of lectures, individual jobs, group exercises, and organizational experts’ lectures.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px"><strong>1.2 </strong><strong>Specific Aims</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px"><a id="_Toc507671540" name="_Toc507671540"><strong>1.2.1 </strong><strong>Knowledge and understanding.</strong></a></span></p>
<p><a id="_Toc507671541" name="_Toc507671541">At the end of the course, students will be able to recognize and deal with organizational problems, having a wide background on the main organizational theories and the principles for their solution, also thanks to models and tools applicable to specific problems in the field of organizational design.</a></p>
<p>This knowledge will be acquired by adopting a multi-level perspective (micro-meso-macro-meta-organizational), aimed at understanding systemic relationships starting from the organization of work at the micro (individual) and meso levels (groups / organizational units), making it possible to investigate emerging properties related to the entire organization (macro level) and business aggregations (meta level), as well as their impact on the firm's performance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the understanding of the links between environmental, strategic and organizational variables allows to analyze and solve problems related to the different strategic profiles and the various phases of the life cycle of companies, in search for consistency between these variables, the emerging organizational forms, and the general economic equilibrium conditions of the firm.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px"><strong>1.2.2 </strong><strong>Applying knowledge and understanding.</strong></span></p>
<p>Through the individual and group work, students will be able not only to understand the origin, nature and typologies of the various organizational problems, but also to elaborate shared solutions by using techniques, models and analysis tools learned during lectures.</p>
<p>The presentation by the students of the results of the group work will allow them to develop reflection and argumentation abilities, together with the ability to exchange, share and display the results achieved.</p>
<p>Finally, Lectures held by organizational experts from leading business organizations and the discussion of the related topics with the students, will allow to corroborate - also with practical feedbacks, the ability to apply the techniques and the results achieved by students themselves, and let them learn from any mistakes made.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px"><a id="_Toc507671542" name="_Toc507671542"><strong>1.2.3 </strong><strong>Making judgements.</strong></a></span></p>
<p><a id="_Toc507671543" name="_Toc507671543">The course, through mixed methods of content delivery (lectures, individual and group work, company testimonials), will dedicate a proper space to main theoretical models in the reference literature, to stimulate students to realize a personal vision of organizational phenomena, encouraging autonomy of judgment and creative solutions, even if guided by the teacher, of the consequent problems.</a></p>
<p>In particular, individual and group work will be designed to increase critical, reflexive and independent judging skills, including that aimed at avoiding the biases that characterize the decision-making processes in this area. solving, also with regard to the ethical and social consequences that distinguish organizational choices.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px"><strong>1.2.4 </strong><strong>Communication skills.</strong></span></p>
<p>The case studies (at individual and group level) and the presentation of their results, will be an important tool used for developing communication skills. In particular, case studies are specifically designed to allow students to learn how to interact and communicate, simulating knowledge sharing activities and building consensus processes that are typical of real work contexts.</p>
<p>These skills represent a "natural" component of the course of Business Organization, and one of the most important issues included in the course program.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px"><a id="_Toc507671544" name="_Toc507671544"><strong>1.2.5 </strong><strong>Learning skills.</strong></a></span></p>
<p>Considering the multidisciplinary nature of the topics the course dealt with, its contents can be easily transferred in different organizational contexts, not only business firms, but also the public administration, non-profit organizations, etc.. For this reason, the course of Business Organization confirms aims to transfer a theoretical, conceptual and applicative knowledge that can be used for a multiplicity of educational and practical paths subsequent to that of the Bachelor degree.</p>
<p>In addition, being the Master Degree the natural continuation of the Bachelor Degree, not only in managerial or business areas, students will acquire skills that can be further developed, even independently, and used in companies, consulting firms and other organizations, as well as for the establishment of innovative, high-tech start-ups.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px"><a id="_Toc507671545" name="_Toc507671545"><strong>1.3 </strong><strong>Prerequi</strong></a><strong>sites </strong></span></p>
<p>Although the issues of the organization can be learned independently from previous economic-business knowledge, an essential requirement for the students is the possession of fundamental notions about the firm’s economics, with particular regard to its nature, its characteristics, and the economic and financial conditions that underlie its operating system.</p>
<p>This knowledge is typically provided in Business Economics and Business Management courses, which for this reason must be considered preparatory to that of Organization Design.</p>
<p>In the case of possible change of teaching by students belonging to Faculties other than the one of Economics, no prerequisites will be provided.</p>
