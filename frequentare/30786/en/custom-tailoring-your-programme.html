<p><span style="font-size:16px"><a href="https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/it/corso/2023/30786/home" target="_blank">Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence ‚Äì Informatica Applicata e Intelligenza Artificiale</a> L-31<br/>are required to submit a course of study (commonly called "Study Plans" or "Completion Plans"), which the competent Commission must approve.<br/>The person responsible for the training pathway is Prof. Angelo Spognardi (<a href="mailto:spognardi@di.uniroma1.it">spognardi@di.uniroma1.it</a>).<br/>The training pathway is presented in the third year before the examination session.<br/><br/><strong>WHAT IS A TRAINING PATHWAY?</strong><br/>A training pathway defines the courses to be examined to obtain the qualification<br/>degree (three-year degree). Students need an educational path to book or take examinations of their choice, but only those that are compulsory for all students.<br/>Only those exams that are compulsory for all.</span></p>
<p><br/><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>WHEN TO SUBMIT ONE'S EDUCATIONAL PATHWAY?</strong><br/>At present, the only non-compulsory subjects in the three-year degree course in Computer Science are allocated to the third<br/>year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px">Therefore, students are invited to present their educational path before the beginning of the exam session of their third year, in order to choose how to complete their curriculum with courses that are not compulsory for everyone.<br/>Students can present or ask to renew their educational path only once for each academic year, according to the following time frame.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:#FFD700">The window for presenting the educational path is  September 15 -- November 30.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br/><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>HOW TO SUBMIT OR RENEW YOUR TRAINING PATHWAY?</strong><br/>Submitting a course of study takes place online via the Infostud system following the procedure described in the<br/>Student Handbook - SIAD - Training Pathways. <strong>Link page: </strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10vPLZKxIqgS1a4SItdhS6lj8OmdRfeIC/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/10vPLZKxIqgS1a4SItdhS6lj8OmdRfeIC/view?usp=sharing</a><br/>The same procedure is used to renew the training pathway by submitting a new path with the modification<br/>of the non-compulsory courses.<br/>Submitting a new pathway is unnecessary if you do not want to make any changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px">If the student pre-choses a Curricular Training Pathway (CTP) and among the "student's choice of subjects" indicates two subjects included in the Manifesto of the Degree Course in Computer Science, they will obtain approval.<br/>Student's choice." He indicates two subjects included in the Manifesto of the Degree Course in Computer Science, and he will obtain the automatic approval of the study plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px">The student recognises this situation from the validation message, which becomes<br/>The proposed course of study is correct and can be approved automatically.<br/>In all other cases, students will have to wait for verification of their course of study by a teacher<br/>in charge of validation.<br/><br/><strong>HOW AND WHEN IS THE EVALUATION OF THE TRAINING PATHS SUBMITTED CARRIED OUT?</strong><br/>Training courses will be assessed and approved within a few weeks by the competent Commission, so students are advised to wait to write in before the end of the system.<br/>Students are advised to write in after two weeks unless strictly necessary. In the case of non-approval, students will be informed of the changes needed to make the<br/>study plan according to the study plan regulations. A student may resubmit a new course with the<br/>necessary corrections immediately after notification of non-approval.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>HOW TO CONTACT THE COMPETENT COMMISSION?</strong><br/>The reference lecturer in the competent commission for the evaluation and approval of training courses for the<br/>degree courses is Prof. Angelo Spognardi, whom you can write to for further information and/or justified requests<br/>for urgent approval (e.g., a learning agreement for the Erasmus programme).</span></p>
